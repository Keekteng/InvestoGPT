The funds provide broad diversification while incrementally decreasing exposure to stocks and increasing exposure to bonds as each fund’s target retirement date approaches. The funds continue to adjust for approximately seven years after that date until their allocations match that of the Target Retirement Income Fund. Investors in the funds should be able to tolerate the risks that come from the volatility of the stock and bond markets.

The level or type of involvement in, or amount of revenue earned from, certain activities or business segments that lead to exclusion by the Index provider can vary from one activity or business segment to another.

The ESG controversies assessment measures a company’s involvement in major ESG controversies and how well they adhere to international norms and principles. Where MSCI, the Index provider’s data source, has insufficient or no data available to adequately assess a particular issuer relative to the ESG criteria of the Index, bonds of such issuer may be excluded from the Index until such time as they may be determined to be eligible by MSCI. Additionally, the Index excludes bonds of companies that fail to have at least one woman on their board of directors and companies for which the Index provider does not have board diversity data.

As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index provider or advisor may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate reporting of ESG data by the companies.

The low-cost fund invests in U.S. Treasury, corporate bonds, and emerging-market bonds. Using a disciplined, risk-controlled approach, the fund seeks to outperform its benchmark through security selection, sector allocation, and duration decisions. Like other bond funds, the fund is subject to interest rate risk; increases in interest rates may cause the price of the bonds in the portfolio to decrease, reducing the fund’s net asset value. This fund is expected to have a meaningful allocation to lower-credit-quality securities, so it is also subject to credit risk; negative perceptions about an issuer’s ability to make its interest or principal payments in a timely manner may cause the price of that bond to decrease. Since the fund invests in all major segments, maturities, and qualities of the fixed income market, investors willing to accept additional risk in their fixed income allocation may consider the fund as a satellite holding.",Taxable Bond,2021-10-12,3000,0.004,Moderate
