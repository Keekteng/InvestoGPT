The fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, U.S. government securities, and/or repurchase agreements that are collateralized solely by U.S. government securities or cash (collectively, government securities). As such it is considered one of the most conservative investment options offered by Vanguard. Although the fund invests in short-term U.S. government securities, the amount of income that a shareholder may receive will be largely dependent on the current interest rate environment. Investors who have a short-term savings goal and are interested in a fund that invests in securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies may wish to consider this option.Important Note: This fund may earn income from investments in repurchase agreements and certain other securities that are generally subject to state and local taxes.", "min_investment": "$3,000", "exp_ratio": "0.11%", "perf_table": {"index": ["Month-end", "3-Month total", "YTD", "1-yr", "3-yr", "5-yr", "10-yr", "Since inception"], "VMFXX": ["0.44%", "1.32%", "4.62%", "4.97%", "2.04%", "1.78%", "1.16%", "3.90%"], "Benchmark1": ["0.40%", "1.21%", "4.17%", "4.48%", "1.80%", "1.48%", "0.88%", "3.51%"]}, "historical_price_table": {}, "portfolio_fundamental_table": {"fundamentals": ["Number of holdings", " Average maturity", "Weighted average life", "Fund total net assets as of 11/30/2023"], "VMFXX": [" 175 ", " 28.0 days ", " 52.0 days ", " $276.5 B "], "benchmark": [" \u2014 ", " \u2014 ", " \u2014 ", " \u2014 "]}, "weighted_exposure_table": {"Issuer type": {"Issuer type": ["Repurchase Agreements    ", "U.S. Govt.
