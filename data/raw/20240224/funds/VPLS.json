The low-cost fund invests in U.S. Treasury, mortgage-backed, and corporate securities, and emerging markets debt of varying yields, maturities, and credit qualities. Using a disciplined, risk-controlled approach, the fund seeks to outperform its benchmark through security selection, sector allocation, and duration decisions. Like other bond funds, the fund is subject to interest rate risk; increases in interest rates may cause the price of the bonds in the portfolio to decrease, reducing the fund\u2019s net asset value. This fund is expected to have a moderate allocation to lower-credit-quality securities, so it is also subject to credit risk; negative perceptions about an issuer\u2019s ability to make its interest or principal payments in a timely manner may cause the price of that bond to decrease. Since the fund invests in all major segments, maturities, and qualities of the fixed income market, investors willing to accept additional risk in their fixed income allocation may consider the fund as a core bond holding.", "min_investment": "$1.00", "exp_ratio": "0.20%", "perf_table": {"index": ["Month-end", "3-Month total", "YTD", "1-yr", "3-yr", "5-yr", "10-yr", "Since inception"], "VPLS (Market price)": ["\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014"], "VPLS (NAV)": ["\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "\u2014", "0.00%"], "Benchmark1": ["4.50%", "0.47%", "2.29%", "1.94%", "-4.05%", "1.00%", "1.66%", "\u2014"]}, "historical_price_table": {"date": ["12/06/2023", "12/07/2023", "12/08/2023", "12/11/2023", "12/12/2023", "12/13/2023", "12/14/2023", "12/15/2023", "12/18/2023", "12/19/2023", "12/20/2023", "12/21/2023", "12/22/2023", "12/26/2023", "12/27/2023", "12/28/2023", "12/29/2023", "01/02/2024", "01/03/2024", "01/04/2024", "01/05/2024", "01/08/2024", "01/09/2024", "01/10/2024", "01/11/2024", "01/12/2024", "01/16/2024", "01/17/2024", "01/18/2024", "01/19/2024", "01/22/2024", "01/23/2024", "01/24/2024", "01/25/2024", "01/26/2024", "01/29/2024", "01/30/2024", "01/31/2024", "02/01/2024", "02/02/2024", "02/05/2024", "02/06/2024", "02/07/2024", "02/08/2024", "02/09/2024", "02/12/2024", "02/13/2024", "02/14/2024", "02/15/2024", "02/16/2024", "02/20/2024", "02/21/2024", "02/22/2024"], "price": ["$75.00", "$75.16", "$74.89", "$74.86", "$75.01", "$75.91", "$76.60", "$76.51", "$76.39", "$76.56", "$76.82", "$76.78", "$76.84", "$76.91", "$77.39", "$77.05", "$77.00", "$76.63", "$76.59", "$76.23", "$76.09", "$76.38", "$76.40", "$76.38", "$76.68", "$76.84", "$76.41", "$76.17", "$76.07", "$76.10", "$76.26", "$76.10", "$75.99", "$76.27", "$76.23", "$76.56", "$76.63", "$76.95", "$77.04", "$76.41", "$75.88", "$76.23", "$76.13", "$76.00", "$75.98", "$76.02", "$75.35", "$75.62", "$75.84", "$75.63", "$75.73", "$75.53", "$75.59"]}, "portfolio_fundamental_table": {"fundamentals": [], "VPLS": [], "benchmark": []}, "weighted_exposure_table": {}, "name": "Vanguard Core-Plus Bond ETF", "risk_level": " 2\n"}
