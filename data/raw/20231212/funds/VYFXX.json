The fund is intended for New York residents only. Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its assets in a variety of high-quality, short-term New York municipal securities. As such it is considered one of the most conservative investment options offered by Vanguard. Although the fund invests in short-term, high-quality securities, the amount of income that a shareholder may receive will be largely dependent on the current interest-rate environment and the availability of eligible New York municipal securities.
