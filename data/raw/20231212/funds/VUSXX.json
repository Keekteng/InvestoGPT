This fund at a minimum invests 80% of the assets in debt issued directly by the government in the form of Treasury bills and in repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. As a government money market fund, this fund is required to invest at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, U.S. government securities, and/or repurchase agreements that are collateralized solely by U.S. government securities or cash (collectively, government securities). As such it is considered one of the most conservative investment options offered by Vanguard. Although the fund invests primarily in short-term U.S. Treasury bills, the amount of income that a shareholder may receive will be largely dependent on the current interest rate environment. Investors who have short-term savings goals and want the added security of investing in a fund in which the majority of the underlying securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government may wish to consider this option.Important Note:\u00a0Income generated from investments in repurchase agreements with the federal reserve are generally subject to state and local income taxes.", "min_investment": "$3,000", "exp_ratio": "0.09%", "perf_table": {"index": ["Month-end", "3-Month total", "YTD", "1-yr", "3-yr", "5-yr", "10-yr", "Since inception"], "VUSXX": ["0.44%", "1.32%", "4.58%", "4.93%", "2.02%", "1.77%", "1.15%", "2.36%"], "Benchmark1": ["0.41%", "1.25%", "4.24%", "4.55%", "1.82%", "1.50%", "0.90%", "1.97%"]}, "historical_price_table": {}, "portfolio_fundamental_table": {"fundamentals": ["Number of holdings", " Average maturity", "Weighted average life", "Fund total net assets as of 11/30/2023"], "VUSXX": [" 32 ", " 42.0 days ", " 46.0 days ", " $63.0 B "], "benchmark": [" \u2014 ", " \u2014 ", " \u2014 ", " \u2014 "]}, "weighted_exposure_table": {"Issuer type": {"Issuer type": ["Repurchase Agreements    ", "U.S. Govt.
