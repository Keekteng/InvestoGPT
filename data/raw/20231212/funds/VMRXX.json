The fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, U.S. government securities, and/or repurchase agreements that are collateralized solely by U.S. government securities or cash (collectively, government securities). The fund invests more than 25% of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services industry, which includes securities issued by certain government-sponsored enterprises.

Although the fund invests in short-term U.S. government securities, the amount of income that a shareholder may receive will be largely dependent on the current interest rate environment. Investors who have a short-term savings goal and are interested in a fund that invests in securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies may wish to consider this option.Important Note: This fund may earn income from investments in repurchase agreements and certain other securities that are generally subject to state and local taxes.", "min_investment": "$3,000", "exp_ratio": "0.10%", "perf_table": {"index": ["Month-end", "3-Month total", "YTD", "1-yr", "3-yr", "5-yr", "10-yr", "Since inception"], "VMRXX": ["0.44%", "1.33%", "4.63%", "4.99%", "2.05%", "1.85%", "1.28%", "2.95%"], "Benchmark1": ["0.40%", "1.21%", "4.17%", "4.48%", "1.80%", "1.55%", "0.98%", "2.43%"]}, "historical_price_table": {}, "portfolio_fundamental_table": {"fundamentals": ["Number of holdings", " Average maturity", "Weighted average life", "Fund total net assets as of 11/30/2023"], "VMRXX": [" 181 ", " 29.0 days ", " 53.0 days ", " $113.0 B "], "benchmark": [" \u2014 ", " \u2014 ", " \u2014 ", " \u2014 "]}, "weighted_exposure_table": {"Issuer type": {"Issuer type": ["Repurchase Agreements    ", "U.S. Govt.
